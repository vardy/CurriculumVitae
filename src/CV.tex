\section{About Me}
Full-stack web developer and back-end software engineer.
I focus keenly on efficiency and cleanliness, taking care to have readable, documented code.

As all of my programming knowledge is self-taught and experienced personally, I feel I have a
deep knowledge of the tech I use in my practise, having taken the hours to debug and understand.

\section{Interests}
To me the most important thing in life is balance -- when I am 
not sitting and working I keep myself active with rock climbing, 
hiking, travelling and other healthy routines to maintain balance.

Furthermore, I am a perpetual student. I strive to keep learning, 
beit code or otherwise, to hone my skills and otherwise keep myself 
well rounded, up-to-date on technology and science, and interested in 
what in my work and my passions.

I love open-source software. All of my code can be found on GitHub, 
where I take time to interact with people looking to contribute to my 
projects, and actively contribute to other open-source projects I use 
and take interest in.
